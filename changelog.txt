	 **********	 
	 This is the default changelog.txt that Sipasi will use to display the example website. 
	 This IS NOT the changelog of the Sipasi software, that you can find on https://github.com/shangril/sipasi/CHANGELOG
	 
	 Once installed on your web server, you will want to edit this file each time you want to log an event related to your Sipasi. 
	 
	 It can be used to organize your work on your Sipasi instance, as well as to inform reader about what changed on your page recently. 
	 
	 It uses a workflow (the "Shangri-l" workflow) description langage for which the basis are:
	 
	 It is suggested that you keep for your visitors the few explanations that follows: 
	  
	 Each entry has a date expressed in YYYYMMDD HH:MM 
	 The ? character is used as a date wildcard when an entry is still planned and/or unfinished. 
	 
	 Each entry has a status, which can be
	 
	 *PLANNED for things that are going to be added
	 *ONGOING when it's currently being in progress
	 *TESTING when it's almost done but not fully validated
	 *DONE when it's finalized
	 
	 each of them can explicitely be a special workflow item, concerning ongoing or finished changes in the Table of Content. Then, it would be marked as
	 
	 *PLANNED TOC
	 *ONGOING TOC
	 *TESTING TOC
	 *DONE TOC
	 
	 In this case, the following keyword are used to describe changes that are made to the Table of Content
	 
	 NEW for a section added
	 MOVE for changing the numeric index of a previously existing section
	 COMPLETE when the corresponding section has been completed by an edit
	 
	 Status for NEW sections 
	 NEW sections can have a status:
	 
	 STUB applies to ONGOING or PLANNED new section. It means that the header titles for the corresponding section have been added to the document body but without any content attached to them 
	 DONE applies to all kind of new section and means that content has been added to the body and the section is consireded as finished. 
	 
	 You can find more information about the Sipasi description language at https://github.com/shangril/sipasi/doc
